# abundance-scaling
A (set of) function(s) to scale given elemental abundances to a given metallicity.

Remember to add to pythonpath to use in other directories.

To try to keep things simple, albeit less flexible, I have saved the outputs of some functions directly to the source code, but those functions and the raw data files still exist.
